    <h1>Tell don't ask</h1>
    <blockquote>
    <p>To ask is a query, to tell is a command</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>This principle concerns how objects interact, specifically
    regarding state and behavior. It emphasizes telling an object what
    to do, rather than asking it for its state and then making decisions
    based on that state externally.</p>
    <p>Rule: instead of querying an object’s state and then performing
    actions based on that state in the calling code, you should delegate
    that responsibility to the object itself by providing methods that
    encapsulate the action and the decision-making logic.</p>
    <p>Goal: to improve encapsulation and place behavior closer to the
    data it operates on. This makes objects more autonomous and
    responsible for their own state and the rules governing it.</p>
    <h2 id="example"><a href="#example">Example</a></h2>
    <p>Asking</p>
    <div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre
    class="sourceCode java"><code class="sourceCode java"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="cf">if</span> <span class="op">(</span>account<span class="op">.</span><span class="fu">getBalance</span><span class="op">()</span> <span class="op">&gt;</span> withdrawalAmount<span class="op">)</span> <span class="op">{</span> </span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    account<span class="op">.</span><span class="fu">debit</span><span class="op">(</span>withdrawalAmount<span class="op">);</span> </span>
<span id="cb1-3"><a href="#cb1-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="op">}</span></span></code></pre></div>
    <p>Telling:</p>
    <div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre
    class="sourceCode java"><code class="sourceCode java"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>account<span class="op">.</span><span class="fu">withdraw</span><span class="op">(</span>withdrawalAmount<span class="op">);</span></span></code></pre></div>
    <p>The logic <code>if (balance &gt; amount)</code> is inside the
    <code>withdraw</code> method of the <code>Account</code> class.</p>

    <p>Following “Tell, Don’t Ask” often helps you adhere to the
    “Principle of Least Knowledge.” When you tell an object to perform
    an operation (<code>account.withdraw(amount)</code>), you don’t need
    to ask for its internal details (<code>account.getBalance()</code>),
    which might involve navigating through other objects, potentially
    violating LoD.</p>
    <p>LoD is primarily about the structure of collaborations (who talks
    to whom), while TDA is about the nature of the interaction (commands
    vs. queries+decisions).</p>
    <p>LoD restricts the scope of interactions, while TDA guides the
    style of interaction towards commands rather than state queries.
    Both contribute to building more robust, maintainable, and less
    coupled object-oriented systems.</p>

    <blockquote>
    <p>For me, tell-don’t-ask is a stepping stone towards co-locating
    behavior and data, but I don’t find it a point worth
    highlighting.</p>
