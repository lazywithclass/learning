    forgetting</a></h3>
    <p>Recognise errors in information retention. Periodicly stop and
    test yourself: * evaluate self * best tool for offsetting
    forgetting</p>
    <p>Active engagement (focus), learn to engage attention, bring back
    your attention to what you’re doing. Put on a hat and focus on
    exactly on what you’re doing. Strain is good. It’s a cue that
    neuroplasticity needs to take place. 10 minutes / day mindfulness
    meditation increases focus. Bring back attention to what you’re
    doing to train to stay focused.</p>
    <p>TODO link to mindfulness meditation! TODO link to nsdr!</p>
    <p>Study 3 or 4 hours per day max.</p>
    <p>Schedule time to study. Do this every day for the next day. Make
    this into a habit. Study alone and then teach others, limit
    distraction. Aspiration component of learning: be attached to
    something that could pull you through. Studying that feels
    challenging is the most effective.</p>
    <aside>
    Effort and testing are key
    </aside>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Effort is the cornerstone of learning. Testing your knowledge
    exposes what you don’t know and offsets forgetting: tests locks the
    material in the mind. Testing right after gives 50% bonus in
    material retention. Best tests are open-ended questions.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Not understanding what you just read or being confused by it
    after being tested is great, you’re cueing your nervous system that
    it needs to learn that material.</p>
    <p>Introduce small gaps (30”) after reading something to allow
    hippocampus to replay that information.</p>
    <p>Self test after being exposed to new material.</p>
    <p>Confidence grows as you read through material multiple times, but
    you haven’t learned anything, it’s false confidence, tests are
    king.</p>
    <p>Read material and then test yourself on what you’ve read.</p>

    Exit low level dopamine situation

    <p>On the x axis there’s time, on the y axis there’s dopamine level:
    there is a steep spike followed by a sudden decrease, the amount of
    time it takes to exit the low dopamine level is proportional to how
    steep the increase was; to get out of such a situation one has to
    engage in an activity much harder than the one they’re struggling to
    start, for example a cold shower.</p>
    <h3 id="active-recall"><a href="#active-recall">Active
    recall</a></h3>
    <p>Explain a concept out loud as if lecturing a class, without
    looking at notes. It’s the only study time that counts.</p>
    <p>It’s time efficient. Concepts last longer in memory. It’s
    difficult, mentally straining, taxing.</p>
    <p>1 or 2 hours of active recall per chunk.</p>
