    <p>Learn through metaphore and analogy.</p>
    <p>Focused mode and diffuse mode, you can’t be in both modes at the
    same time. In diffuse mode you can explore and learn new things,
    that with focus you simply can’t: the green pattern on the left is
    not easily reached.</p>
    <p>In diffuse mode we let our brain wander. During exercise we
    leverage diffuse mode.</p>
    <p>Another analogy could be a flashlight: * diffuse: casts light in
    a broad area, not very strongly on anything in particular * focus:
    casts light more brightly in a narrow area</p>

    <ul>
    <li>diffuse: broad ranging way of thinking (things we’re familiar
    with)</li>
    <li>focus: help keep your thoughts concentrated (exploring new
    things)</li>
    </ul>

    why you feel bad when about to study
    </aside>
    <p>When looking at something we don’t relish doing, neural
    discomfort happens, this is our brain trying to stop that
    stimulation by diverting attention to something more pleasant. Good
    news is that not long after this discomfort disappears.</p>

    <p>It allows to * start, it does not matter if you push through
    without taking the break if you’re midway through something * set a
    limit for the day: today I’m going for 10 pomodoros * promote
    focus</p>

    <aside>
    abstract terms
    </aside>
    <p>Teacher explains that usually scientific terms are abstract and
    are difficult for our brain to comprehend because we cannot point to
    something we can see of feel. She makes the example of a cow,
    explaining how easy it is to understand what the word “cow”
    means.</p>
    <p>It’s important to practice ideas and concepts present in science
    to help enhance and strengthen the neural connections.</p>
    <h1 id="memory"><a href="#memory">Memory</a></h1>
    <p>Working memory: RAM. Long term memory: SDD.</p>
    <p>Spaced repetition is the answer.</p>
    <h1 id="sleep"><a href="#sleep">Sleep</a></h1>
    <p>Sleep is how the brain keeps itself clean and healthy. Ideas are
    tidied up. Strengthen areas we might need or want.</p>
    <p>Plant the seeds for diffuse mode by engaging in focus mode: go
    over what you’re learning right before a nap or before going to
    sleep, you’ve got increased chances of dreaming about it. A step
    further is setting in mind the will to dream about that material.
    Dreaming about what you’re studying can substantially enhance the
    ability to understand.</p>
    <h1 id="chunking"><a href="#chunking">Chunking</a></h1>
    <p>Unite bits of information together through mearning.</p>
    <p>Chunks are pieces of information. Bound together through meaning
    or use. Conceptual chunks are mental leaps that unite scattered bits
    of information through meaning.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Focusing your attention to connect parts of the brain to
    tie together ideas is an important part of the focused mode of
    learning. It is also often what helps get you started in creating a
    chunk</p>
    </blockquote>
    <figure>
    <img src="chunking-octopus.png" alt="|200" />
    <figcaption aria-hidden="true">|200</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Picture an octopus, the octopus of attention that slips its
    tentacles through those slots of working memory when necessary to
    help you make connections to information that you might have in
    various parts of your brain.</p>
    <h2 id="how-to-make-a-chunk"><a href="#how-to-make-a-chunk">How to
    make a chunk</a></h2>
    <p>Learn little by little then piece together everything.</p>
    <p>As an example in learning math: focus on “why is this the next
    thing I should do”, rather then “why does this step work?”.</p>
    <ol type="1">
    <li>focus undivided attentions to what you’re learning - the
    Chunking-Octopus can’t reach very well into the slots of working
    memory <img src="chunking-octopus-failing.png" alt="|200" /></li>
    <li>understanding the basic idea of what you’re trying to chunk</li>
    <li>practice</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Context means learning when to use (and when not to use) the
    technique instead of some other. An example is when you skim through
    a chapter to get a big picture understanding of what you’re about to
    read. <img src="learning-context.png" /></p>
    <p>This is a top down approach. While chunking is bottom up. Both
    are critical to understanding.</p>
    <p>Chunking means learning how to use the technique instead of some
    other.</p>
    <h1 id="recall"><a href="#recall">Recall</a></h1>
    <aside>
    This is how we learn
    </aside>
    <p>After you’ve read, look away and see what you remember of what
    you’ve just read.</p>
    <p>Do the recall in different locations so that you’re not bound to
    the visual cues of the environment where learning happens.</p>
    <p>Flashcards are the best way to do retrieval practice.</p>

    href="#illusions-of-competence-in-learning">Illusions of competence
    in learning</a></h2>
    <p>Looking at a solution is not enough to grasping it. Keeping the
    book opened in front of us when repeating gives the illusion we got
    the concepts, it gives a false sense of knowing what the subject is
    about.</p>
    <h2 id="self-test-yourself"><a href="#self-test-yourself">Self test
    yourself</a></h2>
    <p>It allows to make repairs in your thinking flaws. Mistakes help
    correct your thinking.</p>
