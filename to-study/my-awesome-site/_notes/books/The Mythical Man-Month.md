My fav quote: "The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed from pure thought-stuff. The builds his castles in the air, from air, creating by exertion of the imagination."

"Observe that for the programmer, as for the chef, the urgency of the patron may govern the scheduled completion of the task, but it cannot govern the actual completion"

<aside>Brooks' law</aside>

"Adding manpower to a late software makes it later"

<aside>Choosing tasks</aside>

Demythologizing of the man month
* number of months *depends on* sequential constraints
* max number of men *depends on* number of independent subtasks
