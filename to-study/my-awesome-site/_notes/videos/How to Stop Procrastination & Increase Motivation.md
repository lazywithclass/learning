Leveraging our way our of procrastination

	The depth of a troff after a dopamine peak is proportional to how high the peak was and how steep that peak was, how quickly that peak occurred.
	The rate at which you get out of the troff is proportional to how steep that troff is.

"What would be worse to be in this scenario?" (mind you, always be safe, in no way put yourself even in the slightest form of mental of physical danger), Dr Hiberman is talking about cold showers for example.

Pracrastination *might* eventually evaporate, deadlines *might* eventually come and in a sense help us outside the troff.

Do the activity you should be doing for a few minutes, and use that to start, push up against the friction and use that to jump out of the troff.
