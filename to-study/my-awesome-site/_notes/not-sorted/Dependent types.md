â€‹## What are dependent types?

A language is called dependently typed if it allows for functions from values to types. 
Or in other words, parameterizing a type definition over a value:

```
type BoundedInt(n) = {i:Int | i<=n}

def min(i : Int, j : Int) : BoundedInt(j) =
  if i < j then i else j
```

Refinement types indeed are a simple form of dependent types.
