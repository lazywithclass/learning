# Fugues

Fugues are contrapuntal compositions where a subject (theme) is introduced and then imitated by different voices entering successively.

Contrapuntal compositions are musical works built on the principle of counterpoint, which is the relationship between two or more independent melodic lines that sound simultaneously.


**Tips for Listening:**

- Pay attention to how the subject (the main theme) is introduced and how it reappears in different voices.
- Listen for the interplay between the voices and how they weave together.
- Try to follow the development of the fugue and how the composer uses various techniques, like augmentation, diminution, and stretto.
