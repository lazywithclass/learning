Be cautious about stacking too many dopamine peak inducing behaviors all at once on a regular basis.

Intrinsic motivation is the holy grail of all human endeavors and behaviors. No supplement, book, speech, can replace that.
Identify what you want and then lean into effort, in a persistent way that allows you to reach your goals.
