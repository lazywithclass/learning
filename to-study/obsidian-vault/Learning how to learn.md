Learn through metaphore and analogy.

Focused mode and diffuse mode, you can't be in both modes at the same time.
In diffuse mode you can explore and learn new things, that with focus you simply can't: the green pattern on the left is not easily reached.

In diffuse mode we let our brain wander. During exercise we leverage diffuse mode.

Another analogy could be a flashlight:
* diffuse: casts light in a broad area, not very strongly on anything in particular
* focus: casts light more brightly in a narrow area

* diffuse: broad ranging way of thinking (things we're familiar with)
* focus: help keep your thoughts concentrated (exploring new things)

# Procrastination

<aside>why you feel bad when about to study</aside>

When looking at something we don't relish doing, neural discomfort happens, this is our brain trying to stop that stimulation by diverting attention to something more pleasant. 
Good news is that not long after this discomfort disappears.

## Pomodoro technique

It allows to
* start, it does not matter if you push through without taking the break if you're midway through something
* set a limit for the day: today I'm going for 10 pomodoros
* promote focus

# Practice makes permanent

<aside>abstract terms</aside>

Teacher explains that usually scientific terms are abstract and are difficult for our brain to comprehend because we cannot point to something we can see of feel. She makes the example of a cow, explaining how easy it is to understand what the word "cow" means.

It's important to practice ideas and concepts present in science to help enhance and strengthen the neural connections.

# Memory

Working memory: RAM.
Long term memory: SDD.

Spaced repetition is the answer.

# Sleep

Sleep is how the brain keeps itself clean and healthy.
Ideas are tidied up.
Strengthen areas we might need or want.

Plant the seeds for diffuse mode by engaging in focus mode: go over what you're learning right before a nap or before going to sleep, you've got increased chances of dreaming about it. A step further is setting in mind the will to dream about that material.
Dreaming about what you're studying can substantially enhance the ability to understand.

# Chunking

Unite bits of information together through mearning.

Chunks are pieces of information. Bound together through meaning or use.
Conceptual chunks are mental leaps that unite scattered bits of information through meaning.

> Focusing your attention to connect parts of the brain to tie together ideas is an important part of the focused mode of learning. It is also often what helps get you started in creating a chunk

![|200](chunking-octopus.png)

Picture an octopus, the octopus of attention that slips its tentacles through those slots of working memory when necessary to help you make connections to information that you might have in various parts of your brain.

## How to make a chunk

Learn little by little then piece together everything.

As an example in learning math: focus on "why is this the next thing I should do", rather then "why does this step work?".

1. focus undivided attentions to what you're learning - the Chunking-Octopus can't reach very well into the slots of working memory
![|200](chunking-octopus-failing.png)
2. understanding the basic idea of what you're trying to chunk
3. practice

Context means learning when to use (and when not to use) the technique instead of some other. An example is when you skim through a chapter to get a big picture understanding of what you're about to read.

 This is a top down approach. While chunking is bottom up. Both are critical to understanding.

Chunking means learning how to use the technique instead of some other.

# Recall

<aside>This is how we learn</aside>

After you've read, look away and see what you remember of what you've just read.

Do the recall in different locations so that you're not bound to the visual cues of the environment where learning happens.

Flashcards are the best way to do retrieval practice.

## Illusions of competence in learning

Looking at a solution is not enough to grasping it.
Keeping the book opened in front of us when repeating gives the illusion we got the concepts, it gives a false sense of knowing what the subject is about.

## Self test yourself

It allows to make repairs in your thinking flaws. Mistakes help correct your thinking.
