Learn through metaphore and analogy.

Focused mode and diffuse mode, you can't be in both modes at the same time.
In diffuse mode you can explore and learn new things, that with focus you simply can't: the green pattern on the left is not easily reached.

In diffuse mode we let our brain wander. During exercise we leverage diffuse mode.

Another analogy could be a flashlight:
* diffuse: casts light in a broad area, not very strongly on anything in particular
* focus: casts light more brightly in a narrow area

* diffuse: broad ranging way of thinking (things we're familiar with)
* focus: help keep your thoughts concentrated (exploring new things)

# Procrastination

<aside>why you feel bad when about to study</aside>

When looking at something we don't relish doing, neural discomfort happens, this is our brain trying to stop that stimulation by diverting attention to something more pleasant. 
Good news is that not long after this discomfort disappears.

## Pomodoro technique

It allows to
* start, it does not matter if you push through without taking the break if you're midway through something
* set a limit for the day: today I'm going for 10 pomodoros
* promote focus

# Practice makes permanent

<aside>abstract terms</aside>

Teacher explains that usually scientific terms are abstract and are difficult for our brain to comprehend because we cannot point to something we can see of feel. She makes the example of a cow, explaining how easy it is to understand what the word "cow" means.

It's important to practice ideas and concepts present in science to help enhance and strengthen the neural connections.

# Memory

Working memory: RAM.
Long term memory: SDD.

Spaced repetition is the answer.

# Sleep

Sleep is how the brain keeps itself clean and healthy.
Ideas are tidied up.
Strengthen areas we might need or want.

Plant the seeds for diffuse mode by engaging in focus mode: go over what you're learning right before a nap or before going to sleep, you've got increased chances of dreaming about it. A step further is setting in mind the will to dream about that material.
Dreaming about what you're studying can substantially enhance the ability to understand.
