### Offset forgetting

Recognise errors in information retention.
Periodicly stop and test yourself:
* evaluate self
* best tool for offsetting forgetting

Active engagement (focus), learn to engage attention, bring back your attention to what you're doing. Put on a hat and focus on exactly on what you're doing.
Strain is good. It's a cue that neuroplasticity needs to take place.
10 minutes / day mindfulness meditation increases focus.
Bring back attention to what you're doing to train to stay focused.

Study 3 or 4 hours per day max.

Schedule time to study. Do this every day for the next day. Make this into a habit.
Study alone and then teach others, limit distraction.
Aspiration component of learning: be attached to something that could pull you through.
Studying that feels challenging is the most effective. 

<aside>Effort and testing are key</aside>
> Effort is the cornerstone of learning. Testing your knowledge exposes what you don't know and offsets forgetting: tests locks the material in the mind. Testing right after gives 50% bonus in material retention. Best tests are open-ended questions.

Not understanding what you just read or being confused by it after being tested is great, you're cueing your nervous system that it needs to learn that material.

Introduce small gaps (30") after reading something to allow hippocampus to replay that information.

Self test after being exposed to new material.

Confidence grows as you read through material multiple times, but you haven't learned anything, it's false confidence, tests are king.

Read material and then test yourself on what you've read.

<aside>Exit low level dopamine situation</aside>

On the x axis there's time, on the y axis there's dopamine level: there is a steep spike followed by a sudden decrease, the amount of time it takes to exit the low dopamine level is proportional to how steep the increase was; to get out of such a situation one has to engage in an activity much harder than the one they're struggling to start, for example a cold shower.

### Active recall

Explain a concept out loud as if lecturing a class, without looking at notes.
It's the only study time that counts.

It's time efficient.
Concepts last longer in memory.
It's difficult, mentally straining, taxing.

1 or 2 hours of active recall per chunk.

### How to read 

Prime the chapter.
Ask non-trivial questions to create links.
Remove clutter to explain the concept in a simple manner.

### Sleep

Never skip sleep.

### Neuroplasticity

Ability to change in response to experience.
