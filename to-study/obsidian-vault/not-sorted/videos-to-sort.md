This is a course held by prof Skiena, it's a regular university course so it's pretty long, I've liked it as it gave me
some background on the matter, "some" because it's not an area I find particularly interesting, but if you do this might
be worth. Oh, and prepare to hear lots of "oooook"s and "any questions"s.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8LbkfSSR58&list=PLbgaMIhjbmEnaH_LTkxLI7FMa2HsnawM_">Category Theory 1.1: Motivation and Philosophy (46:45)</a>
</summary>

If you want to deal with more complex problems you have to be able to chop the bigger problems into small problems, solve 
them separately and then combine the solution together: composability. And that's what this is all about.

Abstraction plus composability gives reusability.

Problems with OO are mutations and shared data, which mixed up has a name: data races.
 
Ideas could be expressed in this higher level language (category theory), and later translated into a lower level language.

Category theory is about reasoning about problems.
</details>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p54Hd7AmVFU&index=2&list=PLbgaMIhjbmEnaH_LTkxLI7FMa2HsnawM_">Category Theory 1.2: What is a category? (48:17)</a>
</summary>

Major tools in our arsenal:

 * abstraction
 
Get rid of the unnecessary details, "forget about assembly language".
Things that were different because of unnecessary details become identical, two 
biliard balls might be different under the microscope, but you can replace one for
another when you play.
 
 * composition

If you have an arrow from `a` to `b` (`f`) and from `b` to `c` (`g`), then there always must 
exist an arrow that goes from a to c (`g ∘ f`, which is read as "g after f").

Going from `a` to `b` using `f` and going from `b` to `c` using `g` is identical to going fom 
`a` to `c` using `g ∘ f`.

Composable means that the end of an arrow is the same as the start of another arrow. The 
composition of arrows contains information about a Category.

`h ∘ (g ∘ f) = (h ∘ g) ∘ f` which is associativity

 * identity

For every object there is always an arrow called identity that goes from the object to itself.
So an arrow `f` that goes from `a` to `b` composed with an arrow `idb` that goes from `b`
to `b` I will get back an `f`. 

![composition](img/category-theory-1.2-what-is-a-category.png)

Or in notation `idb ∘ f = f`

Composition and identity define Category Theory.

A Category consists of objects and arrows (morphisms). You could picture that as a graph. 

A morphism is something that goes from an object to another one. You have objects so that you 
could mark the start and end of an arrow. You could have 0 or more arrows between two objects,
in both directions and from an object to itself.

Types are your objects, functions are your morphisms.

Just by looking at the multiplication table of a set, at the morphisms, you can learn a lot 
with this data hiding technique that Category Theory offers. A set's interface is its 
collection of morphisms.

</summary>

Composability and identity are the most important features of a category.

The most important example of a category that we use in programming, is the category
of types and functions. The model for types and functions is sets and functions
between sets.

A mathematical function between sets is total (defined for all arguments) and pure.

Functions have a direction. Multiple elements from the domain could become a single
element in the codomain, also called image.

![domain codomain](img/category-theory-2.1-domain-codomain.png)

The inverse cannot happen.

Given a function `f :: a -> b` is invertible if there is a function `g :: b -> a`, so that
`g ∘ f = id` (and also `f ∘ g = id`), where `id` (identity) is the original element. An 
invertible function is called isomorphism.

A function as something directional, a process that takes place in time, a function that
is not invertible is something that increases entropy: you can't unboil an egg. Abstraction:
I don't care from which point I came from, I am interested about the point in which I end up. 
For example the `isEven` function, I might get a `true`, but I don't know if I started from
`2` or `4`.

![abstraction](img/category-theory-2.1-abstraction.png)

An injective function does not collapse values into a value. If the image covers all the codomain
is called surjective. Injective and surjective makes an isomorphism.

In Category Theory people use Greek, not Latin, so:

 * injective -> monomorphism
 * surjective -> epimorphism

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho7oagHeqNc">Category Theory in Life - Eugenia Cheng (40:38)</a>
</summary>

Sameness, One of the aims of Category Theory

Category Theory is the logical study of the logical study if how logical things work. 
Things only behave logically in the abstract work of ideas. Take for example [London's tube map](http://content.tfl.gov.uk/standard-tube-map.pdf), it's not realistic, it just represents how stop are connected to each other.

We should study things according to their relations with each other, rather then their intrinsic characteristics.
So we should understand everything in context, rather than in isolation.
Relations are called morphisms.

Math is all about trying to organise things efficiently, so we can reason about it more efficiently.

Associativity could be explained as "The grandmother of my mother is the mother of my grandmother".
Another example is:

 * if I mix egg yolk and sugar, then I add milk, and I heat it up, I get custard
 * if I mix sugar and milk, and then I mix egg yold, and heat it up, I do not get custard
 
If I mix sugar, butter, eggs, flour, I can make a cake. The same goes if I mix them in any other order.

Commutativity is the one that enables us to pick the easier one in this equation `8 + 1 = 1 + 8`, which is the one on the left. It's 
way easier to add `8` to `1`, same goes for `(8 + 5) + 5 = 8 + (5 + 5)`.

Isomorphic objects are treated the same by the rest of the category.

Depends what category you're in, Always make clear which context you're in, this is only happening in that context.

Abstracting is forgetting about data that isn't revelevant to the situation, not data that is relevant to the situation.

### Combinators

<details>
<summary>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VQ382QG-y4">Lambda Calculus - Fundamentals of Lambda Calculus & Functional Programming in JavaScript (1:02:14)</a>
</summary>

Idiot (or Ibis) combinator (identity)

```JS
const I = a => a
```

In lambda calculus you have:
 * identifier - defining a variables
 * application - applies a function to arguments
 * abstraction - defines a new function: `λa.b` in JavaScript is `const funx = a => b`
 * grouping - disambiguates operator precedence
 
In lambda calculus all functions are unary, take a single argument.

Beta reduction, scary name but it just means taking a function and applying it to its arguments. For example

```
((λa.a) λb.λc.b)(x)λe.f

       (λb.λc.b)(x)λe.f

           (λc.x)  λe.f
           
               x
```

So we fully evaluated the function, beta-normal form.

Mockingbird combinator (self application)

```js
const M = f => f(f)

M(I) === I(I) === I

M(M) === never // maximum calls stack size exceeded
```

We don't know if some lambda term is going to have a beta normal form, if the process
of reduction ends or not. Sometimes it does, sometimes it diverges. Halting problem.

Kestrel combinator (first, const)

```js
const K = a => b => a
```

Kite combinator (second)

```js
const KI = a => b => b

// which could be also written using the Kestrel and the Identity
const KI = K(I)(x)(y)
// x is dropped, K(I)(x) is I and I(y) is y

```

A combinator is a function with no free variables, `λb.a` is not a combinator,
`λa.b` is a combinator.

Cardinal combinator (reverse arguments)

```js
const C = f => a => b => f(b)(a)

// the Cardinal of the Kestrel takes two things and returns the second
C(K)(I)(M) === M
// which is the Kite
KI(I)(M) === M
```

[At this point](https://youtu.be/3VQ382QG-y4?t=2190) the speaker seem to start talking about a subject similar to the one 
exposed in [programming with nothing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUhlNx_-wYk), so `true` is the `K`estrel and `false`
is the `KI`te.

These are called Church encodings.

`Not = λp.pFT` which in JavaScript is `const not = p => p(F)(T)`.

`CtT = F` and `CF = T`.

`const and = p => q => p(q)(p)`

`const or = p => q => p(p)(q)`

You could "summarise" it like so:

 * whole values
 * combining forms
 * simple laws
 * functions as representations

</summary>

Hire juniors. They inspire seniors to work better, they get trained and they can learn more than seniors usually do.
Why learning functional programming? Because simplicity allows to:

 * reason about code
 * test code
 * prove our code
 * trust our code

Functional programming languages usually limit the power of the user, wink wink to Out Of The Tar Pit.
In functional programming our state is exposed, if it's too complex, it's there as a parameter, so it's much easier
to spot.
Do everything you can without side effects, don't mutate variables, don't handle state (your state should be just in
the tests), compose your functions, then, once you're done introduce side effects.
So our business logic almost never depends on other libraries, while our side effects logic almost exclusively libraries
so we don't have to run unit tests around them.

</summary>

Whirlwind tour at high speed of several concepts.

Functions are things, not really attached to classes or objets, take something in and send something out.

Composition everywhere.

Types are not classes, they're just set of inputs and outputs to functions. A name given to a set of values.

Strive for totality: for every input there's a valid output.
For example in a function that divides `12` by the given input you could do this in two ways to avoid division by zero, and the dilemma
of having to throw exception or not:

 * restrict the input with a type like `NonZeroInteger` that has all integers except `0`
 * extend the output to be optional (`Maybe` monad)

Parameterise all the things.

I *loved* what follows, I really did, he basically started with interfaces, explained how they're a bit bloated and proposed types as substitutes.

Function types are interfaces, if you add the Single Responsibility Principle (only one reason to change) and the Interface Segregation Principle
(don't contaminate interfaces with too many things) and you take that a bit to the extreme you get interfaces with just one function. But an interface
with a single function is just a funtion type, and any function that has the same signature is compatible with it, and you don't have to inherit anything,
it's automatic synce they share the signature!

Partial application, which is useful for dependency injection too allowing to bake in things like database connections.

Continuations, the Hollywood principle: don't call us we'll call you.
Let the caller decide what's going to happen, passing in functions for example to deal with the division by 0 from above.

How to combine a function that outputs two different types with one that accepts just one?
Bind all the things! (monadic bind)

Map allows you to stay in the world of options, so you could call functions on types that you're not sure what value they represent, think about
the result of an async call that returns a `Maybe`, most generic wrapped generic types have a `map`, use it! Functors are just mappable types.

"The purpose of abstraction is not to be vague, but to create a new semantic level in which one can be absolutely precise."

-- Edsger Dijkstra

You don't want to have side effects buried in the code, pull them out separating them calling the side effect function elsewhere and pass
the result.

Functions should not depend on internal structure of data, pull out a new function that knows how to access fields in the data structure.

Distinguish what you calculate and how you calculate that something, pull out the structure into one place.

`null` presence considered a smell.

All functions are a single expression in Haskell and PureScript, so whatever you have in the body that's returned from the function,
and that's completely different from you have in other languages.

Typesystems as a benefit and a friend rather than something you have to please to have your code work.

Good function: isolated, doing one thing, testable. Impure functions should have a small as possible surface area.

Referential transparency and explanation.

Immutability as a solution to multi threaded problems (locking, shared resources, ...), `ref` in Clojure seems a good
approach to this problem.

[Shallow copies and deep copies](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/184710/what-is-the-difference-between-a-deep-copy-and-a-shallow-copy).

In immutable lists if you add elements to the head then you can keep on doing so without impacting
anyone else that have a reference to the previous elements of the list. This passage is at [37:20](https://soundcloud.com/lambda-cast/episode-5-immutability#t=37:20).

So instead of "what does it mean to update and delete" we have "what does it mean to create a new state", we go from one
state to the other.

Introduction of `Maybe`, along with `Either`, to solve the `null` problem. The latter could also help to replace exceptions or
chain stuff with lots of `andThen`s. It basically lifts types to a higher state in which they could be used without worrying

Cathegory theory is the explanation of why and how math works. "Math of math".
A morhpism is a function that takes a type and gives back a type, all pure functions are morphisms

 * endomorphism is a function that takes a type `A` and returns a type `A`
 * isomorphism is a morphism that could be reversed, if you have `A` to `B` you could go back from `B` to `A`; it's more than
 just types, it's about the function inner structure, as some information could be loss when going in a direction. An example
 could going from a `Float` to an `Int`: you can't go back as you've lost some information
 * homomorphism does not change the struction of your thing
 * catamorphism goes from an algebra to another algebra, where an algebra is the set of operations you can do with your thing,
 an example is moving from logs to reports

about the function".

Let's say we have a `List Int -> Int`, what we can say about the function? Well, almost nothing, it can do a lot of things.
This is what I think they meant with the previous sentence. They go through a few different function signatures asking
"what can we tell about this function just by looking at the signature?", it's a powerful discussion that underlines
the importance of having parameters as types.

It's important to know that we know that when they say `f` of `a` `f` is not a function, it's a type; it's not `f(a)`.

If we were to throw immutability and purity away we couldn't think about functions the same way just by looking at the types,
just because we won't have the same constraints.

Parametric polymorphism and polymorphism in object oriented are two separate concepts.

Introduced the concept of functor, which they explained as something that you could `map` over. `f` is mappable is the same
as `f` is a functor.

Reusability of functions and polymoprhic types enable functions reuse, because the type is less specific.

"The purpose of abstraction is not to be vague, but to create a new semantic level in which one can be absolutely precise."

</summary>

A function must be curried to be partially applied. In terms of parameter ordering you have what could configure the function
coming first, then in the last position you want the thing you will act upon, for example you could configure a function to
save an array to the database, the first parameter could be the connection, the second the query, and probably the last
will be the array.

In languages like Haskell you see a function declared as `add :: Integer -> Integer -> Integer`, one might read it as
"`add` is a function that takes two integers and return an integer", but what that actually means is "`add` is a function that
takes an integer that returns a function that takes an integer that returns an integer".

One could imagine a partially applied function as a screwdriver with a detachable head, so you have a function (the
 headless screwdriver) and then you have different heads you could attach to it (parameters) so it's configured for a specific
 task.

They then explain the difference between code that's dense and code that's complicated. Usually in FP you're doing multiple
things on one line, that's more dense for sure, but maybe not more complicated.

<a href="https://soundcloud.com/lambda-cast/12-monoids">LambdaCast 12: Monoids (1:05:33)</a>
</summary>

A semi-group is a data type that has an operation that takes two elements of that type and merge them together to give back an
element of that type. That operation is called append.
This operation obeys the law of associativity, so `a` combined with `b` and then combined with `c` is the same as `a` combined
with `c` and then combined with `b`.
Associativity is of particular help if you need to deal with a huge list for example, because you could use divide et impera.

Integers under addition are a semigroup, integers under multiplication are a semigroup.

A monoid is a semigroup with an identity value for that data type. So for addition it's `0`, for multiplication is `1`. For arrays
it could be `[]`.

By knowing this terminology problems could be lifted in a new space where everyone speaking could bring problems from their area of
expertise into the discussion.

A function that takes an `Integer` and returns an `Integer` is also a monoid, it's composable.

In the monoid of functions that go from `a` to `a` the identity function is the identity value. It doesn't change the thing you're
composing with.

<a href="https://soundcloud.com/lambda-cast/14-dynamic-and-static-languages">LambdaCast 14: Dynamic and Static Languages (1:17:02)</a>
</summary>

In statically typed languages the type lives on the variable, in dinamically typed languages the type lives on the value.

Benefits of dynamic languages: a team of developers from Naught Dog used hot reloading to speed up development time, writing
a game on the PS. So the emphasis is on shorter development cycles.

The faster iteration could be seen as checking things in the REPL, really fast, with immediate feedback. 

People tend to have [fewer data structures with lots of functions acting upon them](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6016271/why-is-it-better-to-have-100-functions-operate-on-one-data-structure-than-10-fun#6160116).

Benefit of static languages: a strong type system allows you to think about the type that you're wrtiing and building up
with those, helps you add more and more functionality with the guarantee that the application still works as you progress.

You write types, lots of them, and the implementation is trivial in the end, because the amount of detail that has been added
is so great that actually the compiler can even write portions of the implementation for you (Idris does this).

About abstractions: for a function that `A -> A`, the only thing you can say it's that is the identity function because you 
don't know how to construct an `A` and without side effects and global state there's no place you could pull that knowledge
from. So types helps you by restricting the amount of things a function can do.

The compiler is there to help, it's not anymore something that you have to keep happy, you want to leverage the help the 
compiler gives you.

As a final thought one might say that the time spent in the REPL in dynamic languages is somewhat "lost"; on the contrary time
spent building types remains in the code.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXDm3WHZT5g">Plain Functional Programming by Martin Odersky (46:57)</a>
</summary>

Greatest difficulty in software engineering is complexity. Software systems get replaced
not when they wear out but when they crumble under the weight of their own complexity.

FP helps by removing one important dimension of complexity: the need to understand
the history of the program in order to understand a single part (a function). Functions
just take parameters and give you a result, no side effect.

The functional way: parameterize all the things, even though it could have problems, for
example having too many parameters.

Raise your abstracts. Category theory.

The great thing in this video is the second part, where Martin Odersky goes through
a real world example on how to use types to make code more adherent to FP principles.

He introduces the notion of Algebraic Effects.

They start with a function that searches for movie titles in a movie database.

First pass: extract functions from the bigger one to name steps, leave the while loop untouched.

Second pass: extract movie database fixture from tests into a variable to reduce duplication, this highlights the fact
that in the function they're modifying the array. Used `for (let element of elements)` to remove the problem.

Third pass: add type signatures on top of functions, as comments.

"If you have a function that returns nothing that's either a) useless or b) containing side effects."

Fourth pass: moving the side effects to the edkges of the application.

Fifth pass: syntax allows for more succint code.

1 in 5 adults suffers from mental health issues. Not so many people talking about.

People affected by mental health issues often hears "I can't believe you're depressed when kids in Africa are starving". 
There's an answer for this: "Telling someone they can't be sad because others have it worse is like saying someone can't be
happy because others have it better".

A questionnaire used to gauge the situation had a question like 

 * "Do you think that discussing physical health with your employer would have bad consequences?"
 * "Do you think that discussing mental health with your employer would have bad consequences?"

Usually there are lots of no in the first and lots of yes in the second.

Being aware of mental helath is especially important if you're a remote worker, after the first couple of months of 
wonderful realisations, people find they're missing discussions with colleagues and all the social interactions that happen
in the workplace. Some things the employer could do to mitigate the problem include but should not be limited to:

 * paying for a month of coworking space, to see if the employee can benefit from that
 * have recurring meetings where everyone meets up

Decorating your workplace is a really helpful thing to do, it makes it more yours.

Empathy is the antidote to shame. From this comes the title of the topic: everyone should offer their empathy to others.

Edwin introduces the concept of Type Driven Development, which he also explains in
[Type Driven Development with Idris](https://www.manning.com/books/type-driven-development-with-idris); type define refine as opposed to
red green refactor.

One thing in common with Test Driven Development, it's about deciding what you're going to do before you do it.
Types are a mean by which you tell the machine "this is what we are going to work on together", it's a dialog with the machine.
Types are first class citizens as functions are in functional programming languages.

You define functions by recursively defined equations.

In type driven development you

 * write the type
 * add the definition
 * split case of the hole name

You coudl also search for a possibile implementation with the proper command.

"Just because you have types doesn't mean you can't add more tests, and you should add more tests."

Look at type holes for hints on how to proceed.

Build functions one bit at a time leveraging the compiler can help you with the types of your holes.

Lowercase letters in types are always implicitly bound.

As soon as you have something a bit hard to do, make another function to do that harder thing.

<summary>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5p8DPbaokE">miniKanren Intro Series #1 (2:06:25)</a>
</summary>

I think it's safe to say that if you know a Lisp you could skip this first video.

miniKanren was originally written as an extension of Scheme, and allows for logic programming.

There's also [microKanren](https://github.com/jasonhemann/microKanren/blob/master/microKanren.scm) which is
a simplified version, 51 lines of Scheme!

The point is to have a very small language, built around 3 or 4 operations, much like Chess or Go, and from
there build new things and think about the system.

William then names the most used Lisp dialects, talks about the benefits of macros, and briefly explains the
history of Scheme and Racket.

What follows is an explanation of the basics that could be found in a Lisp dialect, and later in Scheme.

Meta circular interpreter, implementing Scheme in Scheme, is what we will do later on in this series.

`list?` is pronounced as "list-uh?".

One thing he pointed out is that you could have something like

```scheme
(cond
  [(= 1 0) 'a]
  [(= 0 0) 'b])
```

to highlight the clauses.

<details>
<summary>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8d8uhU-_SY">miniKanren Intro Series #2 (02:27:09)</a>
</summary>

If you went through [The Little Schemer](https://www.amazon.com/Little-Schemer-Daniel-P-Friedman/dp/0262560992) you're going to remember
some of the examples he makes.

Building up recursive functions following test cases is a helpful technique to help
yourself when your're stuck not really knowing how you're going to build up the
result, for example in `member` you could use

```scheme
(member 'x '()) ;; #f
(member 'x '(a x f x g)) ;; #t
(member 'foo '(a foo g)) ;; #t
```

and then build from there the base case (first line), the case in which you've found a thing you were looking
for (second line), and the recursive step or else (third line).
As William said earlier you could even pretend you have your function (whishful thinking) and then use
it to fill the gaps, only to go back later to actually code it, in the videos he names such functions as
`dans-member` if, for example, he was midway coding `member`; it's called `dans-` as in Dan's referring to
[Daniel Friedman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_P._Friedman).

He then talks about `map` and `filter`.

The discussion then changes to quotation, so:
 * quote `'`
 * quasiquote ``\`
 * unquote `,`
 * unquote-splicing `,@`

Another interesting point he makes is that

```scheme
(let ((x 7))
x)
```

is the same as

```scheme
((lambda (x) x)
  7)
```

Macros and `define-syntax` are next.

Small introduction to lambda calculus closes the video.

I love how Chomsky talks about what he calls the two tiered system: Bannon-Trump team dominates the headlines,
so whatever they do that's what people look at, one crazy thing after the other make the headlines, and by the time
the new one arrived the old one is forgotten. And while this goes away things like the EPA slash could be safely
made behind the covers.

They proceed talking about Russia interfering with US elections, the Russian border, and North Korea tensions.

"Why are they developing nuclear weapons? It's a deterrent." North Korea will terminate its further development
of nuclear weapons, in return the US should stop threatening maneuvers on the border.
"If the US did decide to use force against North Korea, [...] Seul (confused) be wiped out by mass North Korean artillery".

Nort Korea was destroyed by the most intensive bombing in history, they flattened the country, leaving no targets left.
Then they attacked the dams, which is a war crime of course. [On the subject](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_on_the_Sui-ho_Dam)

Doomsday clock set at 2min 30sec.

Nuclear weapons and Global Warming both are questions of survival and should be the main focus of attention, every Republican candidate
through the election either denied or said we shouldn't do anything about it.

The Sanders achievement, usually "You can pretty well predict electoral outcomes simply by campaign funding alone", is remarkable
as it represents what could happen if just policies are presented, which meet the concerns of the population.

Trump is not going to bring back jobs, what happens then? Something has to be made to maintain control, so scape goating could be an option,
then an alledged terrorist attack, or a staged attack of minor kind. "It's very easy to terrify people".

Iran has very low military spending, even compared to the region standard (Saudi Arabia, Israel, ...) they want to deter attacks.
If they are developing nuclear weeapons is for their deterred strategy.
"Who's concerned about a deterred? Those who want to use force. [...] So yes Iran is the greatest threat to world peace".

"A time comes when silence is betrayal."

"For we are deeply in need of a new way beyond the darkness that seems so close around us", this is so in line with what's happening these days
(early September 2017) between North Korea and US (again).

"And I knew that America would never invest the necessary funds or energies in rehabilitation of its poor so long as adventures like
Vietnam continued to draw men and skills and money like some demonic, destructive suction tube. So I was increasingly compelled to see the war
as an enemy of the poor and to attack it as such." which is the same thing one asks themself when questioning Trump's actions these days, is being
so belligerant going to help Americans? Is being openly hostile towards people near US south border going to be any good in the long term?

"So we have been repeatedly faced with the cruel irony of watching Negro and white boys on TV screens as they kill and die together for a nation that has
been unable to seat them together in the same schools. So we watch them in brutal solidarity burning the huts of a poor village, but we realize that
they would hardly live on the same block in Chicago. I could not be silent in the face of such cruel manipulation of the poor."

</summary>

It's an introduction to TDD, with some theory and some examples on how to use it.

 * You are not allowed to write any production code unless it is to make a failing unit test pass

Which means you have to write the test first.

 * You are not allowed to write any any more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail; ad compilation failures are failures
 * You are not allowed to write any any more production code than is sufficient to pass the one failing unit test

Unit tests as examples of how your code works.
If you write the tests first it's impossible to write a function that's hard to test, functions are written to be easy to test.
The goal of TDD is to create a test suite such that when it passes you can deploy.
A reliable test suite that passes allows you to make decisions.

TDD is a way to incrementally derive solutions to problems.

Simple is about interleaving not cardinality: not one thing (ex interfaces with one function) but one role / task / concept / dimension.

Elephant of complexity represents the difficulty in maintaining your code.

Simplicity buys you opportunities, it dominates all other factors.
Once your project reaches a certain size the complexity elephant dominates all other techniques you might be using, tests, agile, nothing
will help you pushing the elephant away.

Pursuing simplicity is about pursuing opportunity.

Examples of simplicity in context:

 • order should not matter
 • information is simple, don't put stuff around those, hashmaps are fine
 • take approaches from sub systems architecture and use them into code

Simplicity is a choice.
Requires vigilance, sensibilities, and care. "Did we entangle anything yesterday？ Did we complect anything yesterday?".

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVuEPwNuCHw">Types, and why you should care (1:04:05)</a>
</summary>
 
 Speaker is [Yaron Minsky](https://github.com/yminsky), the one who brought OCaml into Jane Street.
 
 * values - data that flows around in your program
 * variables - a name that points to a value
 * expressions - a collection of syntax that has some meaning
 * types - cathegorisation system for values, grouping related values together
 
In untyped languages values have types, while in typed language values variables expressions have types.

```JS
var x = 5; // value has a type in JavaScript 
```

```Java
int x = 5; // variable and value have a type in Java
```

Statically typed languages, the code that you wrote (the text) has a meaning associated.

Types help communicating intentions and in detecting errors.

There's also [a discussion on HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16622684) about this.

"What is a type system?"
 
In all la guages we have 
 * Data
 * Operations
Not all available operations make sense to all kinds of data. "If you use incompatible pieces of data for your operations 
you will get a representation error".

"Programming languages use a type system to look at a program and determine if a representation error will happen or not".

What strategies could we use to handle those representation errors?

Well you could:

 * perform a type check before running the code - Java - Strong
 * have unpredictable error set and implicit conversions - JavaScript - Weak
 * tag code and try to infer if the behaviour will be correct or not - Static
 * generate code to keep track of the data - Python - Dynamic

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=919dHYHldkc">A Hitchhiker's Guide to the Functional Exception Handling in Java by Grzegorz Piwowarek (38:02)</a>
</summary>

Exception handling like a goto statement, unexpected exit point.

Go for example doesn't throw exceptions, it returns them, because you can actually returns more than one result from a 
function.

One should construct a type safety stronghold, and from there to rule over everything!

Instead of doing

`List<Url> getSearchResults(String searchString) throws IOException { ... }`

one might want to do

`Try<List<Url>> getSearchResults(String searchString) { ... }`

and then

```
getSearchResults("foo")
  .map(...)
  .filter(...)
  .onFailure(ex -> LOG.info("..."))
  .recoverWith(...)
  .getOrElse(( -> 42);
```

[This is the "Try" library he showed](https://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/util/Try.html).

He proposes the use of `Either` type instead of throwing exceptions, which is a type that could have one or another value
but not both. He then speaks about [projections](http://danielwestheide.com/blog/2013/01/02/the-neophytes-guide-to-scala-part-7-the-either-type.html) to be used with `Either`; so in the end we would have

```
Either<FetchError, List<URL>> getSearchResults(String searchString) { ... }

// and then use it like...

result.right() // right projection
  .filter(...)
  .map(...)
  .getOrElse(Collections::emptyList);
  
// ...or...

result.left() // left projection if you're interested in the error
  .map(FetchError::getMsg)
  .forEach(System.out::println)
```

Use exceptions when you don't expect people to recover from them, so for exceptional situations!

 From the same speaker: [A Pragmatic Introduction to Category Theory—Daniela Sfregola - (1:16:35)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss149MsZluI)

A category is two objects and an arrow that connects them, objects could be anything. Objects are types and 
arrows are functions.

You have three properties that come up often:

 * composition
 * identity 
 * associativity

She talks about monoid, which has a way to compose two things of its type and produce a thing of the same type and knows 
that the identity for that type is.

Functors as boxes that can unwrap what they contain.

Combining two boxes into one gives you an applicative, every applicative is also a functor.

Fusing two boxes together is a monad.

The take away from the talk seems to be: forget about the details, category theory is about how things compose.

Computer is a person following a sequence of instructios

He makes the example of three notable scientists (Hilbert, Gödel, Turing), then asks 
"Is mathematics invented or discovered?", given that those three arrived to the same 
conclusions to the "decision problem" independently one could argue that it's discovered.

Propositions as types: Propositions in logic -> types in a programming language\
Proofs in logic -> programs in programming language\
Simplifications of proofs -> evaluation of programs

Curry-Howard correspondence

  * propositions as types
  * proofs as programs
  * normalisation of proofs as evaluation of programs

Dependent types are at the core of languages used to represent proofs.

"Most of you use programming languages that are invented. And you can tell!

[laughter]

So my invitation to you is to use programming languages that are discovered."

Good languages make it difficult to shoot yourself in the foot, but you can still shoot yourself in the foot.

Well typed programs can go very wrong.

Refinement types = Types + Predicates

<summary>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DBjDwKI138">PLSE Seminar Series Ranjit Jhala, "Refinement Types for Dynamic Languages" (1:04:14)</a>
</summary>
The programmer tells what they want to analyse, so types, null pointer, array bounds, information flow, assertions.
 
An example of a refinement type: `{ x : b | p }`, where

 * `x` is the value name
 * `b` is the base type
 * `p` is the refinement
 
Read as "set of values `x` of type `b` such that `p` is `true`".

How to analyse `reduce` and describe its behaviour also as a refinement type?

Given this `reduce` example type signature `function reduce <A, B>(a: A[], B, (B, number, A) => B): B` we can enforce that
`number`, second parameter of the iterator, is a valid index of `a`, as such 
`function reduce <A, B>(a: A[], B, (B, idx<a>, A) => B): B`.

Refinement types = Type analysis + Value analysis

Challenges about implementing refinement types

  * dynamic types
  * assignments
  * mutations
  
Dynamic types -> value based overloading

First a run of the typechecker is made, then we can decorate with the refinement types. Value analysis builds on top of the 
type analysis.

`.d.ts` files are called declaration files.
 
 TypeScript targets EcmaScript 5. So for example arrow functions are compiled into regular functions. But it's a
 configuration setting that could be changed int tsconfig.json.
 
 Exhaustiveness checking is introduced later on after some examples where he discusses a possible functional
 approach to the usual `Shape`, `Rectangle`, `Circle`, `Square` OOP scenario.
 
 Documentation pops automatically up when including a library and having its declaration files with type definitions.

</summary>
 
No need to speed the video, the speaker already goes super fast on his own!

Brief introduction of what TypeScript is.

"What is a type system? A logic system that derives constraints from code structures and reasons about them
systematically to find inconsistencies."

"Turn a 2am production error into a red squiggle in our code"

TypeScript has a structural type system.

Nominal type system -> secret club you need to be invited to
Structural type system -> as long as you meet the minimal requirements you can enter

```TypeScript
type Point = { x: number, y: number }
type Named = { name: string }
type NamedPoint = { name: string, x: number, y: number }
```
`NamedPoint` can be used anywhere `Point` or `Named` is expected. A better approach would be 
`type NamedPoint = Point & Named` (`and`ing together the requirements of both types).

Type-level programming.

```TypeScript
const ident = x => x // value-level
type Ident<T> = T    // type-level

const pair = (x, y) => [x, y] // value-level
type Pair<T, U> = [T, U]      // type-level
```

Towards the end the speaker wonders if the type system is Turing complete or not, 
well: https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/14833

</summary>

State is your enemy.

Persistent state - storage, db, cookies, session
Transiente state - url state, ui state

Flux data architecture: Action (dispatched from the view) -> Dispatcher -> Store ->
View -> Action. It's a very controlled way on how to manage your data, it's 
unidirectional. Redux is an implementation of Flux.

Flux

 * centralised state
 * unidirectional
 * reducers are pure functions, state transitions can be reproducers at any time
 * simple to reason about
 
To deal with async calls one could use ngrx effects.

Common state patterns:

 * async operations with error handling - `loadSuccessAction`, `loadFailedAction` which
 are reducers handled like events
 * optimistic update
 * load more button / infinite scrolling
 * process steps / state machine - easily handle that in the reducer

<a href="https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-redux">Getting Started with Redux (2:01:25)</a>
</summary>
 
[Here are some notes](https://github.com/tayiorbeii/egghead.io_redux_course_notes) on the course.

#### [Redux](https://redux.js.org/): The Single Immutable State Tree

This is the first principle.

The state describing all of the application, including the data and the UI state is 
represented as a single JS object, all mutations and changes of state are explicit.

#### Redux: Describing State Changes with Actions

This is the second principle.

The state tree is read only. When you want to change it you dispatch an action, which
describes the change, it is the minimum representation of the change.

Only requirement is that has a `type` property.

#### Redux: Pure and Impure Functions

Pure functions
 * return value depends just on inputs
 * no side effects
 * just calculate the new value, if you call them with the same argument you will get
 the same result
 * do not modify arguments
 
#### Redux: The Reducer Function
 
This is the third principle.
 
UI is more predictable when it is described as a pure function of the application's 
state. State mutations in Redux are desxribed as pure function, argument is the 
previous state and action, and return the next state of the app.
 
#### Redux: Writing a Counter Reducer with Tests
 
If the reducer receives `undefined` as state it must return the initial state of the
application.
 
#### Redux: Store Methods: getState(), dispatch(), and subscribe()
 
`createStore` accepts a reducer and creates the store.

Store holds current application state, lets you dispatch actions.

`getState` retrieves the current state.

`dispatch` dispatches actions to change the state.

`subscribe` register a callback any time an action is `dispatch`ed.

#### Redux: Implementing Store from Scratch

```js
const counter = (state = 0, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'INCREMENT':
      return state + 1;
    case 'DECREMENT':
      return state - 1;
    default: 
      return state;
  }
}

const createStore = (reducer) => {
  let state;
  let listeners = [];
  
  const getState = () => state;
  
  const dispatch = (action) => {
    state = reducer(state, action);
    listeners.forEach(listener => listener());
  };
  
  const subscribe = (listener) => {
    listeners.push(listener);
    return () => {
      listeners = listeners.filter(l => l !== listener);
    };
  };
  
  dispatch({});
  
  return { getState, dispatch, subscribe };
};

const store = createStore(counter);

const render = () => {
  document.body.innerText = store.getState();
};

store.subscribe(render);
render();

document.addEventListener('click', () => {
  store.dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' });
});
```

To avoid mutation one could you `Object.assign`, `Object.freeze`, ora a library like
[Immutable.js](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/).

#### Redux: Writing a Todo List Reducer (Adding a Todo)

All reducers should return the current State.

It's ok to call reducers from other reducers, try to build them so that you can call them
by passing the current state and an action.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lI3IcjFg9Wk">"Redux: Architecting and scaling a new web app at The NY Times" by Juan Carlos Montemayor Elosua (41:16)</a>
</summary>

`app = ui(state)`

UI comes back to life once given a state, looks like this process is called hydration in Redux lingo.

Pure functions do not depend on other things generally ([also kind of said by Martin Odersky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXDm3WHZT5g)).

3 principles in Redux:
 * single source of truth
 * State is read only
 * State changes are made through pure functions
 
Views -> Actions -> Reducers -> State -> Views -> ...

Views - user doing something
Actions - side effects
Reducers - update the State

He introduces the concept of selectors and derived data, the goal is to have a small State, so you use functions to fill in 
the gaps, for example if you need to show the `username` which is `name` concatenated to `surname`, you don't store 
`username`, you store only `name` and `surname` and compute the other whenever needed.

Personal doubt: how much data should I put in the Redux store? Do you put everything in there? Do you put things you don't 
need in the `localStorage` and then put them in the State when needed? [Here's one take](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/issues/1287) from the creator of Redux.

Selectors remind me about [lenses](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8307370/functional-lenses).

Set aside a place in your app to deal with side effects, or impure functions, as far as possible from the rest of the 
application. If something wrong happens you possibly know at this point that it might be dirty thing, you can point your 
finger basically.

Middleware in Redux can help you deal with side effects, so imagine that before and after the reducers, so you can massage
the data.
