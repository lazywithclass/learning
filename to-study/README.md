## Learning to study

This is basically my [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault, along with my flashcards export from [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/).

To generate images / schemas / etc on the fly I use [Figma Jam](https://www.figma.com/jam).

### Deploy

```bash
$ cd site
$ vercel deploy --prod
```

Readable on [learn](https://learn.lazywithclass.com/).
