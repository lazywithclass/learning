## Learning Lisp

Where I learn Lisp using Clojure, to get also some kind of market value.
This is better followed by evaluating expressions in your IDE, I used Emacs with Cider.

I will follow all books from Daniel Friedman:

 * The Little Schemer (going through this from scratch)
 * The Seasoned Schemer
 * The Little Prover
 * The Little Typer
