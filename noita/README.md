# Learning to play Noita

## Resources

I try not to look too much at the following, to keep the experience fun and to discover new stuff each time.

* [DunkOrSlam](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwBEhH4-1iOnI2GQBIT0Ohg) - lots and lots of advice and howtos
* [Noita Wiki](https://noita.fandom.com/wiki/Noita_Wiki) - the wiki

## Notes

Don't take the item on the left before entering the first biome, it curses you.

## Noteworthy seeds

This is almost like a journal, so I can come back later and try to discover as many secrets.
