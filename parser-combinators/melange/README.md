# Melange

A parser combinator library written in OCaml.

Heavily influenced by [this excellent series](https://swlaschin.gitbooks.io/fsharpforfunandprofit/content/series/understanding-parser-combinators.html).

Do not install Dune through Nix, do it via opam; remember `dune` is in `~/.opam/default/bin/dune`.

### Commands

Remember to run `eval $(opam env)`

## Build

``` shell
$ dune build
```

## Test

``` shell
$ dune test
```
